# SeleniumTest

in this Repository for Selenium Test 
i use FireFox Driver and i download **geckodriver** from this in GitHub https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases 
you can put this file where you want put you 
can update the Path system variable to add the full directory path to the executable
or
you can use  System.setProperty("webdriver.gecko.driver", "path\\geckodriver.exe");
or
you can put the file in the same Directory for the Project as I do it.
