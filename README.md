* in this Repository for Selenium Test 
* i use FireFox Driver and i download **geckodriver** from this Link in GitHub https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases 
* you can put this file where you want  
* can update the Path system variable to add the full directory path to the executable
* or
* you can use  System.setProperty("webdriver.gecko.driver", "path\\geckodriver.exe");
* or
* you can put the file in the same Directory for the Project as I do it.
